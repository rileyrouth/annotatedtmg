## Rain in Soho [^rain] [^in] ## {#soho}

No one knows where the lone wolf sleeps \\
No one sees the hidden treasure in the castle keep \\
No one learns the secret name [^yhwh] \\
No one burns in the absent flame \\
No one broke D.B. Cooper’s [^cooper] fall \\
No one hopes to hear the bagman call \\
Children piping in the main square \\
But no one’s dancing, no one’s dancing down there [^piping]

The river goes where the water flows \\
But no one knows when the Batcave [^batcave] closed \\
The river goes where the water flows \\
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

No promise sweeter than a blood pact \\
Nothing harder to go through with than a vanishing act \\
No morning colder than the first frost \\
No friends closer than the ones we’ve lost \\
Nothing sharper than a serpent’s tooth \\
Nothing harder than the gospel truth \\
Though you repent, and don sackcloth, and try to make nice, \\
You can’t cross the same river twice [^river]

The river goes where the water flows \\
But no one knows when the Batcave closed \\
The river goes where the water flows \\
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

There’s a club where you’d like to go \\
You could meet someone who’s lost like you [^club] \\
Revel in the darkness like a pair of open graves \\
Fumble through the fog for a season or two

No town more barren than our town \\
No haven safer than the one they tore down \\
No greater love than to lay my life down for a friend [^greater] \\
No sweeter pleasure than to see the credits clear through to the end \\
No one knows where the lone wolf’s gone \\
No one sees him camped out right there on the front lawn \\
We played for you but you would not sing \\
No one's going to get away with anything

The river goes where the water flows \\
But no one knows when the Batcave closed \\
The river goes where the water flows \\
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

    lay down one’s life for one’s friends." (New International Version)


## Andrew Eldritch is Moving Back to Leeds [^andrew] ## {#eldritch}

There's indifference on the wind, but a faint gust of hope  
At a club nobody goes to with a musty velvet rope  
Guys in Motörhead [^motörhead] jackets who knew him way back when  
Haven't raised a drink in years but now meet up again  
To remember how it was when they all thought they'd move away  
And ride in Lotus Sevens [^lotus] through the London streets one day  
  
Nobody ever gets away  
Even the best of us come back someday  
To the unmarked rooms where the dry dust breeds  
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds  
  
There's a rusted fog machine in a concrete storage space  
Letter-number combinations with no meaning on its face  
They won't make these any more, it's a wooden coach-and-four  
No one will even steal it if you leave it by the door  
With no sign to mark its going, no tombstone for its grave  
There will be goodbyes by dozens, so practice being brave  
  
No one anticipates the rush  
The breezy feeling of the faceless crush  
At the end of things where the selvage bleeds  
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds  
  
They don't throw him a parade  
He just comes in on a train  
One suitcase in his hand, and an old army backpack  
From the second World War  
From a Leipzig [^leipzig] second-hand store  
  
Pick the keys up from the agent, everything's been taken care of  
No big changes in the roadways since you left that I'm aware of  
A few old buildings gone to dust, and some new ones in the way  
They'll look just like the old ones when the winds have had their say  
See the children bound for London, you'll all be back too  
Everybody tests the membrane, but no one pushes through  
  
Come on boys, that'll be enough  
You'd think your old friends wouldn't play so tough  
Like a basket by the Nile hiding down among the reeds [^nile]

## The Grey King and the Silver Flame Attunement [^fangs] ## {#greyking}

In the secret caverns underneath West Covina [^covina]  
Half desperate for peace with the surface dwellers  
But coming to no conclusions  
And now we emerge, sky grey and misty  
  
The Grey King in his new Pontiac [^pontiac]  
Some of us sworn to the effort, trying to get our shapes back  
Teeth filed down to fine points  
Framework too tight, strain at the joints  
  
And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore  
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore  
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore  
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore  
  
Load into the Grand Am, [^pontiac] doomed sailors  
Borne high by the waves, wild with wonder  
Leather and lace, and good friends  
Most of them good, most of them friendly  
  
The Grey King at the rail, sparks flying  
Three of us in the car with him, scared of dying  
All eyes on the front seat  
Assuming his form, reborn in the heat  
  
And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore  
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore  
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore  
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore


[^fangs]:
    "I get off work, uh, and I go to the onramp to the freeway. You can see the scene depicted on our tour poster back there at the table. And there's some people that are my age, maybe a year or two older, but they're clearly a little deeper into some scene than I am. I don't think they're probably working eight hours a day shifts. They're probably quitting jobs a little quicker. And they have long hair that's feathery and, and, the roach clip, you know, with the feathers you can put in your hair, looks - still looks good today, a fashion trend that will never die. And there was a guy, right, one of those guys whose shoulders seem to have widened a little earlier than everybody else's, you look at him and he, like, radiates testosterone, you know, uh, uh, and, you know, and then, like, three women in the car. And he's wearing shades, and we're both getting onto the same freeway. I'm not even trying to stare at this guy. I'm just looking over, making sure I'm aware. And he sort of catches me with his sunglasses. Makes sure I'm looking at him. He smiles. He had fangs. I wrote this song about him." – Saturn, Birmingham, AL, May 25, 2017.

## We Do It Different on the West Coast ## {#westcoast}

The papers write about it back in England  
It's practically a lifestyle in Berlin  
There's probably some pockets in Ohio  
Almost always something happening in Ohio  
  
I heard some bad reports about Long Island  
I don't trust what people say about Long Island  
I heard some good things from some friends about Chicago  
I gotta see with my own eyes about Chicago  
  
We do it different on the west coast  
We do it different on the west coast  
We do it different on the west coast  
We do it different on the west coast  
  
I heard they had a problem with some skinheads  
At a show in a machine shop in Pomona [^pomona]  
I feel like half my friends have moved to San Francisco  
I think I'm gonna bleach my hair this weekend  
  
And Dave went to New York, I don't care  
You can't shut people up  
Once they get back from their Christmas out there  
  
Skim through such magazines as I can get my hands on  
Glue circuitboards to plywood on the weekend  
Trellis modulation [^trellis] for the children  
There's a whole new world just up around the corner  
  
We do it different on the west coast  
We do it different on the west coast  
We do it different on the west coast  
We do it different on the west coast

## Unicorn Tolerance ## {#unicorn}

Drawn to the dark  
Covered by the blood, [^covered] when possible  
Called to the corners  
To any open crucible  
Easy to reach  
Bearing every mark unmissably  
Want to leave behind some token  
Of what I carried with me  
Search in the storm drains  
Sleep in the underpasses  
Try hard to look hard  
Behind my blackout sunglasses  
  
But I have high unicorn tolerance  
I have high unicorn tolerance  
I have high unicorn tolerance  
I have high unicorn tolerance  
  
Swim with real sharks  
Those who never speak when spoken to  
Hard limits fade into memory  
Once broken through  
Scaling the well [^scale]  
Every single day, instinctively  
Feel shame, real shame  
For what my friends must think of me  
  
Dig through the graveyard  
Rub the bones against my face  
It gets real nice around the graveyard  
Once you've acquired the taste  
And when the clouds do clear away  
Get a momentary chance to see  
The thing I've been trying to beat to death  
The soft creature that I used to be  
The better animal I used to be  
  
Draw where I'm drawn  
Seldom wonder why, just follow You [^you]  
Never blame the rags that swaddled me  
For the place the river took me to [^rags]  
Long life to the spiders!  
Safe travels to the crow!  
Love to the ghosts  
Who taught me everything I know  
  
But I have high unicorn tolerance  
I have high unicorn tolerance  
But I have high unicorn tolerance  
I have high unicorn tolerance

[^covered]:
    "Covered by the blood" is an Evangelical phrase meaning one who is saved by Jesus; also the title of a 1904 [Christian hymn](https://hymnary.org/text/once_in_sins_darkest_night_i_was_wanderi).
  
[^scale]:
    Scaling is buildup of minerals in a well-pipe that eventually may make the well useless.

[^you]:
    In the lyric booklet, this "You" is capitalized, indicating that it means God. John has confirmed this: "There are two songs, 'Unicorn Tolerance' and 'Wear Black,' with 'you,' the second person or addressee, where I went back and forth on whether to capitalize the 'Y' or not. If I didn’t capitalize the 'Y' it’s only because I wanted people to figure it out, right? I don’t like to telegraph my punches. So those are the big theological songs on this record." — [Observer interview](https://observer.com/2017/05/mountain-goats-band-john-darnielle-interview/), May 2017, retrieved January 2025.

[^rags]:
    Possibly [another](#fn:nile) reference to the story of Moses being set adrift in a basket on the Nile river when he was an infant.

## Stench of the Unburied ## {#unburied}

Incoherent but functional  
Speeding like a dead comet  
Purple crushed velvet waistcoat  
Flecked with Maalox [^maalox] and bits of dried vomit  
Say what you will for the effort,  
You can't fault the technique  
Still conscious at sunrise  
For the third time this week  
  
But when the blue lights flash  
I know we're going to crash  
  
And outside it's 92 degrees [^92°]  
And KROQ [^kroq] is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees [^siouxsie]
  
Blaupunkt [^blaupunkt] in the dashboard  
Cracks in the cylinder block [^cylinder]  
Heading up the Golden State Freeway [^golden]  
Toward Eagle Rock [^eagle]  
Ice chest full of Corona [^corona]  
And pineapple Crush [^crush]  
It'll take twenty years  
For the toxins to flush  
  
And when the sirens wail [^vision]  
I know we're going to jail  
  
And outside it's 92 degrees  
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees  
  
Follow the flame to freedom  
The flickering lights of Armageddon  
Find the foot of the ladder  
Way down in the pit  
Keep climbing forever  
Try to keep the torch lit  
  
And outside it's 92 degrees  
And KROQ, the Roq of the 80s [^kroq], is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

## Wear Black ## {#black}

Rain every day  
Fog all night  
Wind in the evergreen cypresses  
See me, Lord of Wind and Rain  
See me, Guardian of the Underpasses  
  
Wear black when it's light outside  
Wear black when there's no light  
Wear black following the left hand path  
Wear black when I get right  
  
Waves at night  
Hard waves at dawn  
All this coast is vanishing  
Check me out, I can't blend in  
Check me out, I'm young and ravishing  
  
Wear black on your forgotten radar  
Wear black in the present tense  
Wear black when you come around  
Wear black in your absence  
  
Wear black high as a kite  
Wear black dead sober  
Wear black when the trouble starts  
Wear black when it's over  
  
Sun through the trees  
Head for the sun  
Can't find the path back to the main road  
See me, Lord of The Thomas Guide [^thomas]  
See me, Keeper of the Source Code  
  
Wear black to the intervention  
Wear black back to the car  
Wear black wherever I go  
Wear black wherever You [^you] are

## Paid in Cocaine ## {#cocaine}

Crusty boots in the corner of the closet by the tackle box  
Once-proud shining silver buckles safe behind the normalcy locks  
Baubles and bangles, a lost age  
Still all aglow with the radiance of the stage  
  
That's who I was, this is who I am  
Work to pay down the interest on the mortgage  
Used to get paid by the gram  
  
Long Beach  
Long Beach, can you hear me?  
Can you hear me, Long Beach?  
Long Beach  
Long Beach, can you hear me?  
Can you hear me, Long Beach?  
  
Master tape from the show we did at Fender's back in '85  
Dark paisley from Retail Slut  
All four of us still fresh and alive  
Flashes and phosphenes, it's hard to believe that's me  
Strapped in, visibly sweating  
As happy as I'm ever gonna be  
  
You're by my side  
Five years left on your card  
You're cashing out, all dressed up  
For your date with the emergency ward  
  
Long Beach  
Long Beach, can you hear me?  
Can you hear me, Long Beach?  
Long Beach  
Long Beach, can you hear me?  
Can you hear me, Long Beach?

## Rage of Travers [^pat] ## {#travers}

Close the balcony at the Rainbow [^rainbow]  
Because the promoter says so  
Aviators and a buckskin frontier hat  
How come they dress like that  
They break the news to me so gentle  
But I start to feel sentimental  
This used to be the place to go  
Still draw pretty good in Ontario [^pat]  
  
Nobody wants to hear the 12-bar blues  
From a guy in platform shoes  
  
Let's just have a good time when the show's done  
Ask where the good clubs are, and go find one  
Roll up to the curb, spill out of the car  
Everyone's dressed up like corpses, I brought my guitar  
Set it down by the stage  
The singer's locked up in a steel cage  
Shaking the bars, eyes wild with fear  
I don't belong here  
  
Nobody wants to hear the 12-bar blues  
From a guy in platform shoes


[^pat]:
    This song is likely about the rock musician [Pat Travers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Travers), who was born and raised in Toronto, in the Canadian province Ontario.

[^rainbow]:

## Shelved ## {#shelved}

I want to ride the hydraulics  
Lit up like the North Star  
I want to wallow in the spoils before the crowd  
I want to play my guitar  
Not gonna sit up and beg  
Not gonna do tricks  
Not gonna stand here on a soundstage  
Tethered to a crucifix  
  
The ride's over, I know  
But I'm not ready to go  
  
I want to flash my pastel colors by the rail  
On a windy day at Pimlico  
Don't wanna write songs with this clown they set me up with in a Los Angeles rehearsal studio  
Not going to tour with Trent Reznor [^reznor]  
Third of three, bottom of the bill  
You can't pay me to make that kind of music  
Not gonna swallow that pill  
  
The ride's over, I know  
But I'm not ready to go  
  
Maybe Dad is right: I'm still young  
And I can write C++ just as good as anyone  
I know this guy at LucasArts, he says they're looking for hands  
In fifteen years I'll be puttin' back beers with my feet in the sand

[^reznor]:
    [Trent Reznor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Reznor) is an American musician best known as the leader of the band Nine Inch Nails. 

## For the Portugese Goth Metal Bands ## {#portugese}

Sift the spectrum for the greyscale, that's better  
Favor bold fonts in blackletter  
Star-crossed lovers and their tragic fates  
And that one Celtic Frost record almost everybody hates  
  
Candlelight playing its tricks on the walls of the cave  
Hauling these songs to the light from the mouth of the grave  
  
Mark the map out for the treasure, don't say where  
Find the octave in the shadow, and stay there  
Sleep till sunset, stay up late  
Bleed bile all night into an SM58  
  
Candlelight playing its tricks on the walls of the cave  
Hauling these songs to the night from the mouth of the grave  
  
Finally head west, but it's a dead end  
Come home dead broke but still among friends  
Keep what's precious, drop what's not  
Without a second thought  
  
There's not so many of us  
But you don't know any of us  
Work like a gravedigger, let the blood spill  
Headline really big festivals every other summer in Brazil  
  
Candlelight playing its tricks on the walls of the cave  
Hauling these songs to the light from the mouth of the grave




## Abandoned Flesh ## {#flesh}

Robert Smith is secure at his villa in France  
Any child knows how to do the spiderweb dance  
Siouxsie has enough hits to keep the bills paid  
Every New Year's in Los Angeles, you can still see Richard Blade  
  
But the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel  
Yes the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel  
  
They charted once or twice, they were on a major label  
When the singer went solo, he left money on the table  
The two main guys are related, they're at war with each other  
Now there's two Genes loving Jezebel – One for each brother  
  
But the world  
Came to agree  
What you see is what you get  
And what you get is what you see  
Whether you're The March Violets or The Bolshoi  
Bands who had to leave the darkness for the sun  
Red Lorry Yellow Lorry were on Cherry Red, I think  
They've been playing clubs since 1981  
  
To be fair to Gene Loves Jezebel, Billy Corgan brought them onstage  
It was in 2011, it's on their Wikipedia page [^wikipedia]  
But for the most part, however big that chorused bass may throb,  
You and me, and all of us, are going to have to find a job  
  
Because the world will never know or understand  
The suffocated splendor  
Of the once and future goth band

[^wikipedia]:
    That same [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Loves_Jezebel#In_popular_culture) now mentions how this song references it.
